# Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status

accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in git notes,
as described by git-adr. This approach:

- Keeps ADRs invisible in the working tree but visible in history
- Eliminates merge conflicts from sequential numbering
- Associates decisions with implementing commits
- Syncs automatically with regular git operations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Decisions are documented and searchable
- Context is preserved for future team members
- ADRs don't clutter the repository file tree
- Natural integration with git workflow

### Negative

- Team members need to learn git-adr commands
- Git notes require configuration for remote sync

### Neutral

- Existing file-based ADRs can be imported
